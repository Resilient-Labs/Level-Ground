title="Why"
content="LG provides academic and career opportunities to youth living in the Boston
neighborhoods that face the highest levels of poverty and violence. Through our “Success
Tracks,” our youth are empowered to overcome these obstacles and pursue the future that
they envision for themselves. Youth may opt to enter college, or pursue a career in the
fitness industry. To date, 100% of our graduating seniors involved with LG for at least 6
months have transitioned to college and/or meaningful employment.

But it doesn’t stop there.

We are committed to making MMA and Personal Training options financially accessible to all
Boston residents. Obesity-related chronic diseases are on the rise, and are most prevalent
in urban neighborhoods In fact, the average life expectancy in the Boston neighborhood of
Roxbury is just 58 years old. Our young trainers assist with our MMA classes and lead our
“Beat 58” Personal Training program, thereby serving as ‘fitness ambassadors’ to their
community."
